# Transactional Data Store (TDS)
This is the database that is optimized for transactions giving you fast inserts, updates & deletes of business data. It is used by an application for day-to-day operational tasks. It might contain your sales data, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Supply Chain Management (SCM) or another line of business application for your company. 

The data is normalized which means no duplicate data is stored in the tables. This reduces data redundancy and inconsistency to achieve data integrity.
